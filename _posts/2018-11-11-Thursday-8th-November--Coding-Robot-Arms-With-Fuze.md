**Coding Robot Arms With Fuze**

**Thursday 8th November**

In the lesson, me, Ben, Hector and Timo used Fuze to code a robot arm to move.

We coded its body,shoulder,wrist,light and its hand. We experimented with the arm to first grip onto Ben's tie, then we coded it to pick up a 10p coin from the table and drop it into Timoâ€™s Hand. After this, we tried to make it do a hand shake with Hector  but was to slow in the process. Our next aim for the coding of the arm, is to remote control it by pressing a certain key.
