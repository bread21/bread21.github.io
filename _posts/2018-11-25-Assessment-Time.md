**_Assessment Time_**

**Thursday 22nd November**

In today's lesson, I switched over to a new three with Ben D and Scott G. We did assessment chapter 1 and saved it into my USB drive. We made it so it typed "Hello World" in the chat and changed the speed of the words coming out from fast to slow. We also changed the inked used into different colours.
