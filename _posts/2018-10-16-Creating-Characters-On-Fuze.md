**Creating Characters On Fuze**

**Thursday 11th October**

In the lesson, me and Ben coded one of the exercises in the booklet which was a little clip looping to say " I Love Space Invaders". Then we were taught how to code our own characters. We then started trying to create a character from the game Borderlands 2, called SpringTrap.
