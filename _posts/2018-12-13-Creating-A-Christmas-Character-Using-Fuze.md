**Creating A Christmas Character Using Fuze**

**Thursday 13th December**

In this lesson, I used the Fuze box to create a Christmas Character. I used DefChar which is short for define character. I used binary to code the character. I created the Grinch and made it say "I'm Going To Steal Your Presents".
