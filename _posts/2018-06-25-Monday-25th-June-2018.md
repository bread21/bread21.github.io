Lesson Feedback Date: Monday 25th

                                           June 2018

In today's lesson we watched videos which asked you two questions that you had to make a choice by pressing on one of the choices shown. We worked as a whole class. As the video progressed through the lesson the story line of the videos got darker as many things happened. More bad events had occurred which had also changed the story. At the end of the story, we were shown what had happened to the 4 main characters at the end.
